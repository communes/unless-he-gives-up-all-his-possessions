# Unless He Gives up All His Possessions


## Getting Started
If you know how to use git versioning but don't know how to use xelatex no worries! Just put comments in the document noting what text should be added and anything else you want. Use the percent character at the beginning of each line. For example:
```
%add text below here:
%This is some text I really thing should go here.
```    

You can also make suggestions with comments:
```
Unless He Gives up All His Possessions %this title is too big and the font is too boring, please change it! Also it stinks.
```

## Versioning

We are looking at different versioning options. Please suggest some to us. We don't know how we should version a document like this \:\)
<!-- We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/your/project/tags). -->
